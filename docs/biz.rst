BizMS
=====

BizMicroservices are microservices obtained by composition of TechMicroservices. The composition is defined with the
AWS Step Function technology.

BizMicroservice is trigerred by event and behaves like reactor.

YAML Description
****************

We prefer YAML to JSON to describe composition of microservice mainly for simplicity and concisness.
The YAML description is then translated to Step Function JSON language and data parameters are generated.

YAML CoWorks language is not as powerfull as JSON Step Function language; it is a simplified subset for
TehMicroservices composition.
