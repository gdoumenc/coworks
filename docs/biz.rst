BizMicroservices
================

``BizMicroservices`` are microservices (or services) defined by the composition of technical microservices.
They are defined by a ``YAML`` description of the state machine associated.
As defined as a state machine diagram the ``BizMicroservice`` is more easy to understand, more easy to explain to others
and more easy to change. On the other hand, as defined as a state machine, the dataflow must be simple or the diagramm
will look as a spaghetti plate.

Before describing the content of a ``BizMicroservice`` take a look at the global service that we need to provide to
help the composition of microservices :

Global Microservices
--------------------

Discovering
^^^^^^^^^^^

``DNSBizz`` is a global microservice for helping the discovery and integration of technical services.
This services acts like a DNS service for network.
It provides name resolution to all the microservices that are on the path of the workflow.

Logging
^^^^^^^

``Logizz`` is a global microservice providing how user requests travel through your entire workflow.
It aggregates the data generated by the individual microservices and resources that make up your workflow,
providing user an end-to-end view of how his ``BizMicroservice`` is performing.

Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CopBiz`` is a global microservice for controlling rights to execute other microservices and access to associated ressources.

Versionning
