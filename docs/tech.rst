TechMS
======

TechMicroservices are the 'atom' of the Coworks microservices framework. They represent the building blocks
for other more complex microservices.

Routing
-------

Routes are defined by function names in the microservice class.
The function names must follow the syntax below::

	<request_method><associated_route>

The request method is then defined for the associated route.
Composed routes are defined with the ``_`` separator.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following function defines the GET method for the root of the microservice:

.. code-block:: python

	def get(self):
		return "root"

The following function defines the GET method for the route ``/service/test``:

.. code-block:: python

	def get_service_test(self):
		return "service test"

The following function defines the PUT method for the root of the microservice:

.. code-block:: python

	def put(self):
		return "put"


Entrypoint Parameters
---------------------

URI Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define entrypoint function arguments as part of the URI:

.. code-block:: python

	def get_content(self, index):
		return f"get content {index}"

This defines a route which first part is the fixed string ``content`` and the second part is the ``index`` value.
We denote the route like this::

	/content/{index}

You can have several positional parameters (ordered from the URL path):

.. code-block:: python

	def get_content(self, bucket, key1, key2, key3):
		return f"get content of {bucket} with key {key1/key2/key3}"

which defines the route ``/content/{bucket}/{key1}/{key2}/{key3}``.

*Note*: In this case, the keys parameters must not have the ``/`` character.

You can also construct more complex routes from different parameters:

.. code-block:: python

	def get_content(self):
		return "get content"

	def get_content_(self, value):
		return f"get content with {value}"

	def get_content__(self, value, other):
		return f"get content with {value} and {other}"

This defines the respective following routes::

	/content
	/content/{value}
	/content/{value}/{other}

This is usefull for offering a CRUD microservice:

.. code-block:: python

	def get(self):
		return "the list of instances of a model"

	def get_(self, id):
		return f"the instance with id {id}"

	def put(self, data):
		return f"creates a new instance with {data}"

	def put_(self, id, data):
		return f"modifies an instance identified by {id} with {data}"

*Note*: `API Gateway` only accepts numbered parameters for routes, so the uri_parameters are renamed
for deployement as::

	/content
	/content/{_0}
	/content/{_0}/{_1}

The actual routes are defined this way for the microservice.
This will not change anything in code but it must be known for `Step Function` calls.

Query or body parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can define default parameters to your entrypoint function.
In that case the value of those default parameters are defined by query parameters or JSON body content.

.. code-block:: python

	def get_content(self, id=None, name=""):
		return f"the instance with id {id} and/or name {name}"

Where the ``id`` parameter can be defined by the query parameter::

	/content?id=32&name=test

Or in python code using the ``requests`` module::

	requests.get("/content", params={"id": 32, "name": "test"})

or by a JSON structure::

	request.get("/content", json={"id": 32, "name": "test"})

A list parameter can be defined by a multi value parameter::

	/content?id=32&name=test&name=other

Which is equivalent to the JSON call::

	request.get("/content", json={"id": 32, "name": ["test", "other"]})

*Beware*: With `API gateway` you can only use query parameters for a GET method, and body
parameters with a GET method will raise an error in execution.

You can also use the ``**`` notation to get any values::

	def get_content(self, **kwargs):
		return f"here are all the parameters: {kwargs}"

**Note**: The current implementation doesn't take into account the typing of the entrypoint function parameters (forcasted).
So all query parameters are from type ``string``.
If you want to pass typed or structured values, use the JSON mode.

Microservice Response
---------------------

As for ``Flask`` and ``Chalice``, the return value from a class microservice is automatically converted into a response object for you.

* If the return value is a ``string`` or ``bytes``, itâ€™s converted into a response object with the string or bytes list as response body, a 200 OK status code and a text/html mimetype.
* If the return value is a ``dict`` or a ``list``, it's converted to a JSON structure.
* If a ``tuple`` is returned the items in the tuple can provide extra information. Such tuples have to be in the form (response, status), or (response, status, headers). The status value will override the status code and headers can be a list or dictionary of additional header values.

If none of that works, ``Coworks`` will assume the return value is a valid
``Chalice`` `Response <https://chalice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#Response>`_ instance.

Test
----

Tests may be made in two ways:

* Online test
* Classical test with test tools like pytest

As a classical python application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As seen, you can run your microservice locally with the command::

	$ cws run

You can also run you microservice in a classical way of python application:

.. code-block:: python

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		app.run()

You can add more options for testing such as changing the port or the stage::

	$ cws run --port 8001

The same goes for python application:

.. code-block:: python

	if __name__ == '__main__':
		app.run(port=8001)

To get the list of options::

	$ cws run --help

PyTest
^^^^^^

To create your tests for pytest, add this fixture in your ``conftest.py``::

	from coworks.pytest.fixture import local_server_factory

Then

.. code-block:: python

	def test_root(local_server_factory):
		local_server = local_server_factory(SimpleExampleMicroservice())
		response = local_server.make_call(requests.get, '/')
		assert response.status_code == 200

If you want to debug your test and stop on breakpoint, you need to increase request timeout:

.. code-block:: python

	def test_root(local_server_factory):
		local_server = local_server_factory(SimpleExampleMicroservice())
		response = local_server.make_call(requests.get, '/', timeout=200.0)
		assert response.status_code == 200

If you have an authorized access:

.. code-block:: python

	def test_root(local_server_factory):
		local_server = local_server_factory(SimpleExampleMicroservice())
		response = local_server.make_call(requests.get, '/', headers={'authorization': 'allow'})
		assert response.status_code == 200

Blueprints and Extensions
-------------------------

Blueprints
^^^^^^^^^^

Coworks blueprints are used to add to your application more routes deriving from logical components.
Blueprints allow you to complete your microservices with transversal functionalities.

Blueprint Registration
**********************

Blueprints are defined in the same way as microservice classes.

.. code-block:: python

	from coworks import Blueprint

	class Admin(Blueprint):

		def get_context(self):
			return self.current_request.to_dict()

This blueprint defines a new route ``context``. To add this route to your microservice, just register the
blueprint to the microservice.

.. code-block:: python

	app = SimpleExampleMicroservice()
	app.register_blueprint(Admin(), url_prefix="/admin")

The ``url_prefix`` parameter adds the prefix ``admin`` to the route ``context``.
Now the ``SimpleExampleMicroservice`` has a new route ``/admin/context``.

Predefined Blueprints
*********************

Admin
:::::

The admin blueprint adds the following routes :

``/routes``

	List all the routes of the microservice with the signature extracted from its associated function.

``/context``

	Return the deployment context of the microservice.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

Extensions are extra packages that add functionalities to a Coworks application.
Extensions are inspired from `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/extensions/>`_.


Predefined Extensions
*********************

Writer
::::::

Writers are extensions used by the ``format`` option of the ``cws export`` command. It uses Jinja templating to
generate service description.
