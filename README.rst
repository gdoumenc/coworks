CoWorks is an unified compositional microservices framework over AWS technologies and
based on the `Chalice <https://github.com/aws/chalice>`__ microframework.
The aim of this project, is to offer a very simplified experience of microservices over the awesome technologies of AWS.

Each atomic microservice (Tech Microservice) is a simple python class deployed on the serverless Lambda product and
composition of microservices (Biz Microservice) is performed over the Step Function product. Other AWS products are used
for logging, administrate, ...

Get started with `installation <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ and then
get an overview with the `quickstart <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_.
Read `faq <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html>`_ for a quick presentation,
a complete presentation can be found `here <https://coworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Installation
------------

Install the extension with::

    $ pip install coworks

Let's see how it works
----------------------

As a simple example is often more helpful and descriptive than a complete manual, lets write our first simple
microservice in file `app.py`.

.. code-block:: python

	from coworks import TechMicroService

	class SimpleExampleMicroservice(TechMicroService):

		def get(self, usage="test"):
			return f"Simple microservice for {usage}.\n"

	app = SimpleExampleMicroservice(app_name="demo")

initialize the coworks project::

    $ cws init

Then make our microservice run locally::

    $ cws run
    Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
    127.0.0.1 - - [26/Dec/2019 18:29:11] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -

Now test our microservice::

	$ curl http://127.0.1:8000
	Simple microservice for test.
	$ curl http://127.0.1:8000?usage=me
	Simple microservice for me.

Now complete it with more entrypoints:

.. code-block:: python

	from collections import defaultdict
	from coworks import TechMicroService

	class SimpleExampleMicroservice(TechMicroService):
		values = defaultdict(int)

		def get(self, usage="test"):
			return f"Simple microservice for {usage}.\n"

		def get_value(self, index):
			return f"{self.values[index]}\n"

		def put_value(self, index, value=0):
			self.values[index] = value

	app = SimpleExampleMicroservice(app_name="demo")

Now test our completion::

	$ curl http://127.0.1:8000/value/123
	0
	$ curl -X PUT -d '{"value":456}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.1:8000/value/123
	null
	$ curl http://127.0.1:8000/value/123
	456
	$ curl -X PUT -d '789' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.1:8000/value/123
	null
	$ curl http://127.0.1:8000/value/123
	789


Deploy this first simple microservice on AWS with Chalice
---------------------------------------------------------

Just deploy the microservice::

    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
    $ chalice deploy
	Creating deployment package.
	Updating policy for IAM role: simple-dev
	Updating lambda function: simple-dev
	Updating rest API
	Resources deployed:
	  - Lambda ARN: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:760589174259:function:simple-dev
	  - Rest API URL: https://bd2ht6jc2m.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/

Then test it::

	$ curl https://bd2ht6jc2m.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/
	Simple microservice for test.

Delete it
---------

Just delete the microservice with ::

	$ chalice delete
